# hello-world
I already have a GitHub account because I made a mod of a game once that sucked. You're welcome.

I created the account in 2019, after a game called "Friday Night Funkin", started picking up traction. I decided it would've been a funny idea to try and use it for a two quick cents of fame but fell through pretty early. I now code, do voice acting, and a bunch of other things for mods of the game now though.
